DuckDB offers the performance and the flexibility of SQL right within the python environment.

it is speciifcally engineered for OLAP

Data is distributed in chunks. while spark is distributed across multiple nodes to achieve scalability.

DuckDB is columnar storage format while MYSQL and SQLITE are row based.

ELT - In DuckDB, we can directly manipulate the data instead of loading it into database server (in traditioonal ELT, we need to load the data)

DuckDB process data in vectors. operating with chunks of rows rather than processing one row at a time.

DuckDB uses a technique called late materialization, where data is only fetched or processed when absolutely necessary. 

DuckDB is in-process database, meaning it runs directly within the application, without needing of seperate server.



OLTP -> Captures real time operational data

OLAP -> for analytics and business insights
